Pebble watchapp to show info about public transport waiting time on different bus stops in Lviv, Ukraine.  
Uses API of [lad.lviv.ua](https://lad.lviv.ua).  
Geolocation option (last item in menu) allows to get info about nearby bus stops.  
Each predefined stop is configurable from phone, you can get stops numbers from [lad.lviv.ua](https://lad.lviv.ua).  
Because of API responses in Ukrainian language all the titles and texts on watch are also in Ukrainian.
